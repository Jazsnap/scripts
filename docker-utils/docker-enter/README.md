# Docker-Enter Script

The `docker-enter` script is a Bash function that facilitates entering the namespace of a Docker container's running process. This allows you to execute commands within the context of the running container's environment.

## Purpose

Docker containers isolate applications and their processes from the host system and from each other. Occasionally, you may need to troubleshoot or debug issues within a running container, and this script simplifies the process of accessing a container's environment.

## How It Works

The `docker-enter` function takes a single argument, which is the container ID or name. It retrieves the process ID (PID) of the container's main process using the `docker inspect` command. It then uses the `nsenter` tool to enter the container's namespace, enabling you to execute commands as if you were inside the container.

The script sets up the required environment to enter the container namespace, and you can use it to run commands interactively within the container.

## Prerequisites

- The script assumes you have Docker installed on your system.
- The `nsenter` tool is required to enter the container's namespace. Ensure it is available on your system.

## Usage

1. Save the script to a file, for example, `docker-enter.sh`.
2. Make the script executable: `chmod +x docker-enter.sh`.
3. To enter a container's namespace, run the script with the container ID or name as the argument. For example: `./docker-enter.sh my-container`.

Please exercise caution when using this script, as entering a container's namespace can have security implications. It's recommended for debugging and troubleshooting purposes only.
